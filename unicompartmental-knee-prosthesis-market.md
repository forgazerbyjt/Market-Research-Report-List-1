<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Unicompartmental Knee Prosthesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented Bone</li><li>Non-Cemented Bone</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The unicompartmental knee prosthesis market is categorized into cemented and non-cemented types based on the fixation method. Cemented prostheses use polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) to bond the implant to the bone, offering immediate stability and load-bearing capacity, making them suitable for patients with good bone quality. Non-cemented prostheses rely on porous surfaces that promote bone ingrowth, allowing for long-term fixation without cement. This option is often favored in younger, more active patients with good bone stock.</p></p>
