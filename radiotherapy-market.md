<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiotherapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Beam Radiotherapy Devices</li><li>Internal Beam Radiotherapy Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The radiotherapy market comprises two primary types: external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and internal beam radiotherapy (IBRT). EBRT devices deliver targeted radiation from outside the body to treat tumors, often utilizing technologies like linear accelerators and proton therapy. In contrast, IBRT, also known as brachytherapy, involves placing radioactive sources directly inside or near the tumor for localized treatment. Both methods aim to effectively destroy cancer cells while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues, thus playing crucial roles in cancer care.</p></p>
