<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diaphragm Pacing Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Diaphragm Pacemaker</li><li>Diaphragm Pacemaker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The diaphragm pacing device market is primarily segmented into two types: external diaphragm pacemakers and implantable diaphragm pacemakers. External diaphragm pacemakers deliver electrical stimulation through electrodes placed on the skin, facilitating breathing in patients with respiratory failure. They are usually temporary solutions for acute conditions. In contrast, implantable diaphragm pacemakers involve surgically placed electrodes directly on the diaphragm, providing long-term respiratory support for chronic conditions. Both types aim to enhance respiratory function and improve the quality of life for affected patients.</p></p>
